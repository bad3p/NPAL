In CG, the realism of illumination from area lights is due to their naturalness - because most of the natural light sources we observe in everyday life are in fact area lights. Yet in real-time computer graphics, area lights are represented mostly in some sort of pre-calculated form because of their computational expensiveness. 
The method presented in this work allows us to easily introduce illumination from arbitrary planar polygonal area lights in real-time shading.
